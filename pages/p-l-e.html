        <h2>Part I</h2>
        <h3 class="gold-title">Hypothesis: Language can allow non-human primates to create culture by building a generational memory.</h3>
        <div class="box"><ol class="gold-title">
            <li>It's how we did it, I think this is accepted.</li>
        </ol></div>
        <p>Yet to prove:</p>
        <div class="box">
        <ol class="gold-title" start="2">
            <li>The mental differences between humans-with and humans-without language are similar to the mental differences between humans-with-language and non-human primates.</li>
            <li>Non-human primates can learn and make use of language.</li>
            <li>The mental similarity between non-human primates with language and humans-with-language is greater than the mental similarity between humans-with and humans-without language.</li>
            <li>Non-human primates can potentially use language to create culture.</li>
        </ol></div>
        <h2>Part II</h2>
          <p>So, language allows humans to efficiently share, accumulate, and organize information in a way that has snowballed into what we call civilization today, right? Which begs the question: what is a human like withouth language? Every culture on Earth has it's own tongue(s), so the closest examples we have are feral children - children who missed the developmental milestone for language. There's always a massive amount of trauma here, but they generally seem stuck with a relatively narrow internal life and stunted reasoning capabilities, regarless of the precise cause. Mandatory CS analogy: the computer is powered on, but no one installed an operating system.</p>
          <p>In contrast, I believe primate language subjects Washoe (chimpanzee/ASL), Kanzi (bonobo/AAC), and Koko (gorilla/ASL) each individually learned, used and - at least partially - though in language, and I think beyond allowing two way communication, there is evidence it enabled them to have a richer internal world than they otherwise would have experienced.</p>
          <p>I think it would be worthwhile to do many more such experiments (we know three species with potentially language capable members - we've made a huge step already). I think it would be enlightening to see if they can pass language down in a self-sustaining way with the goal of eventually fostering a second primate culture on our planet (and if I'm dreaming *really* really big, maybe in turn that would broaden our horizons as a species or at the very least be kinda cool.)</p>
          <p>The time frame would of course be long. Resource concerns, global warming, and the ever present human urge to exploit pose challenges, but I don't think we would necessarily have to resort to genetic engineering or speculative intelligence boosters to jumpstart a (ideally very unlike the movie) Planet of the Apes.</p>
          <p>Chomsky's criticisms of research so far strike me as so graspingly nuanced that I'm comfortable dismissing them with a "Monkey brain don't work precisely like yours, Noam. You of all people should understand that." He seems bent on clinging to a form of romantic human exceptionalism, and it pisses me off that his naysaying seems to have squashed a lot of interest in the subject.</p>
        <h2>Part III</h2>
          <p>Chomsky has been adamant that only humans are capable of language. He says we've maybe conditioned primates with symbol systems which they can use to influence their environment, but he's unconvinced they're actually using language. To me, his objections mainly seemed to be, "they have horrible grammar, they don't make complex sentences, and they don't ask a lot of questions." He's a smart man, probably smarter than me, but I think he's expecting too much too soon.</p>
          <p>Knowing his background, I would be incredibly surprised if Chomsky had not read and been heavily influenced by Alfred Korzybski (to my understanding, cognitive science could be described as General Semantics 2.0). One of Korzybski's big ideas is the Semantic Time-Binding Principle: at some point humans figured out how to efficiently communicate complex ideas and how to pass those ideas forward in time (first one generation at a time, further once we invented writing). Civilization snowballed from there. He specifically makes a point of saying that is "The Defining Feature of Mankind".</p>
          <p>A corollary to this: if the thread is severed for even a single generation, we're starting from scratch. All the books in the world are useless if no one can read them (or even talk to each other).</p>
          <p>The closest we have to that thread being broken is feral children. I don't have precise sources here, I was just really into the subject a couple years ago. But I recall people who studied/worked with cases like that frequently coming away with a sense that they were not interacting with what is normally expected from a "human mind", that it is a very different feeling even than communicating with a deaf person without knowing ASL. There's always a level of trauma involved here, but some feral children were raised in homes with families who never bothered to teach them language. They had (some) social interaction, so language really seems to be the key here. Contrasting this is the level of empathy/"humanity" demonstrated by Washoe/Kanzi/Koko.</p>
          <p>So given all that, given the fact that even humans learn language one generation at a time, given arguably succesful experiments in raising primates *from an early age* with language, Chomsky's objections sound more like, "They didn't earn it themselves, so they don't deserve to use it." I think he's adhering too closely to the words of an old idol.</p>
          <p>Primates have yet to demonstrate the time-binding aspect, but they definitely seem to have semantic capabilites. I think we should probe a lot further.</p>
