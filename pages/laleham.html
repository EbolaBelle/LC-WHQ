        <h1 class="white">A Brief Account of the Laleham Family; Their Origin, History and Biology</h1>
        <div style="border: 1px dashed goldenrod; height: fit-content;"></div>
        <p>The Lalehams originated more than 1000yrs ago in the fens of their homecountry. 878A.D. a foundling child, Hrodberht Laelhamm is found wandering the Ouse Washes, caked in mud, muttering:</p>
        <p>"Tha mise, Hrodberht Laelhamm, air mo bhreith bhon bhoglach, a rugadh airson a bhith a ’sgaoileadh taise tro shaoghal na grèine. Bidh mo theaghlach a ’fàs agus a’ sgùradh talamh ar nàimhdean le craiceann tioram."</p>
        <p>(trans. "I, Hrodberht Laelhamm, am born of the bog, born to spread dampness through the sunlit world. My family will grow and scour the earth of our dry-skinned enemies.")</p>
        <p>True to his word, more than 30 damp and mud-caked children were discovered over the next two years. Colloquially they became known as "Wægn wearg cynren Laleham bice". (trans. "Those fucking Laleham bitches".)</p>
        <p>Though they were always considered outsiders, shut-out from local communities and forced to live off the wild moors (a position, it must be said they accepted, if not outright cultivated), the Lalehams did well for themselves. Through their own stock and limited interbreeding with the Anglo-Saxon and (eventually) Norman populace, their numbers had grown to a reported 788 by the mid-16th century. Indeed, they enjoyed a peculiar level of respect: it was said that no leader, from the King down to the lowliest Bishop, could properly rule without the backing of a Laleham.</p>
        <p>"Laleham or lose him!" was a popular rallying cry for peasants of the period.</p>
        <p>In fact, the modern phrase "Let me sleep on it" stems from the period exhortation, "Let me sleep on peat 'stead of pillow, let the mists of night wash a Laleham to my slumbering form; that they might drip the sweat of wisdom in my ears and by their muddy track shall I know mine action 'pon the morn."</p>
        <p>Sadly, the English Civil War shook the sluggish politics of the Sceptered Isles and displaced the Lalehams from their former prominence.</p>
        <p>But the advent of English naval power brought new opportunities: the Laleham Colonial Diaspora.</p>
        <p>No longer confined to the fens, moors, and bogs of their homeland, Lalehams currently flourish in wetlands across the world. Whether it's a swamp or a marsh; a river basin or just a river valley, you will find Lalehams. Wherever there exists mud and gnats, wherever there exists inland aquatic danger (whether its the snap of an alligator's jaw or an easily preventable drowning), you will find Lalehams.</p>
